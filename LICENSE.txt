The license of the main part (the c code) of this library can be found
below.

For reasons of consistency, the binding code is shipped under the same
MIT-style license.

However, I really don't care. You can also distribute the OCaml part
under the GPL (version 2 or later), LGPL (2 or later, with and without
the usual linking exception), the CDDL, or the Simplified BSD License.
